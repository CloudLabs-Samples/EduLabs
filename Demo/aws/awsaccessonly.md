# AWS Environment

Before starting the hands-on lab, kindly note that the lab duration will be shown at the top right corner of your lab environment page once the lab is launched by clicking the **Launch Lab** button. The time will be ticking automatically, so it's important to keep an eye on it while performing your lab tasks.
