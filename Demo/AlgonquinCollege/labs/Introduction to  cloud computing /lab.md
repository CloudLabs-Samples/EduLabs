# Lab 5: Introduction to Cloud Computing

## Prerequisites:
A VM with **Azure Data Studio** and **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** pre-installed has been provided to you; please use these tools for the lab.

## Lab Steps:

## SQL Databases

A **SQL Database** is a type of database that uses **Structured Query Language (SQL)** to manage and manipulate relational data. SQL databases store data in **tables** (rows and columns), where each table represents a different entity, and relationships between entities are defined using keys (e.g., primary and foreign keys).

Key features of SQL databases include:
- **Structured Data**: Data is stored in tables with predefined structures.
- **Relational Model**: Data is linked across tables using relationships such as primary and foreign keys.
- **SQL**: The language used to interact with the database, including querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data.
- **ACID Properties**: Ensures that database transactions are processed reliably and maintain data integrity (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
  
Examples of SQL databases include **Microsoft SQL Server**, **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Oracle Database**. These databases are widely used in various applications, including business systems, e-commerce, and financial applications.

In cloud computing, services like **Azure SQL Database** allow users to manage relational data in the cloud without the need for physical infrastructure management.

### Step 1: Create a SQL Database
1. **Create a new SQL Database** on Azure for a development workload environment:
   - Log into your [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
   - In the left sidebar, click **Create a resource**, then search for **SQL Database**.
   - Click on **SQL Database** and then click **Create**.
   - Fill in the necessary details:
     - **Subscription**: Choose your active subscription.
     - **Resource Group**: Select or create a new resource group.
     - **Database Name**: Choose a name for your SQL Database.
     - **Server**: Either select an existing server or create a new one.
     - **Subscription**: Choose your subscription.
   - Select **Locally Redundant Storage** (LRS) for backup options.
   
2. **Enable both SQL and Microsoft Entra authentication**:
   - In the **Authentication Method** section, select both **SQL Authentication** and **Microsoft Entra authentication**.
   - For SQL Authentication, you will need to specify the SQL admin username and password.
   - For Microsoft Entra Authentication, ensure your Azure Active Directory (AAD) credentials are ready to use.

3. **Select Locally Redundant Backup Storage**:
   - Under the **Backup** section, choose **Locally redundant** as the backup storage redundancy option. This ensures that backups are stored in the same region for high availability.

4. Take **screenshots**:
   - Screenshot showing the configuration of the **SQL database** creation form.
   - Screenshot focusing on the settings where you enable both **SQL Authentication** and **Microsoft Entra Authentication**.
   - Screenshot of the backup configuration where you select **Locally Redundant Storage**.

### Step 2: Login to the Database
1. **Login to the database** using **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** or **Azure Data Studio**.
   - Open SSMS or Azure Data Studio and connect to the SQL Database server created in Step 1.
   
2. **Login with SQL Authentication**:
   - Enter the **SQL login** credentials that you set during the database creation in Step 1 (SQL admin username and password).
   - Click **Connect**.
   - Take a screenshot showing the credentials being entered in SSMS/Azure Data Studio and confirm the successful sign-in.

3. **Login with Microsoft Entra Authentication**:
   - In SSMS or Azure Data Studio, select **Azure Active Directory â€“ Password** as the authentication method.
   - Enter your **Microsoft Entra** credentials (username and password).
   - Click **Connect**.
   - Take a screenshot showing the credentials being entered and confirm the successful sign-in with Microsoft Entra authentication.

### Step 3: Delete Resources
All the resources will be deleted automatically once the lab duration is exhausted.

**Note**: Make sure to follow the lab instructions carefully and ensure that the necessary configurations and settings are applied during each step.
