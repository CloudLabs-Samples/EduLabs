# Module 1: Introduction to the AWS Console and Global Infrastructure

## üìñ Scenario
You are a new cloud practitioner at a startup exploring AWS for the first time. Your team wants you to understand how to access AWS services, what global infrastructure looks like, and how to navigate the AWS Management Console.

---

## üéØ Learning Objectives
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- Sign in to the AWS Management Console
- Identify AWS global infrastructure components: Regions, Availability Zones, and Edge Locations
- Use the region selector
- Explore the "Global Infrastructure" page and related services

---

## üß∞ Prerequisites
- An active AWS Free Tier account ([Sign up here](https://aws.amazon.com/free/))
- Basic internet access and browser

---

## üìù Instructions

### Step 1: Sign In to the AWS Console
1. Go to [https://console.aws.amazon.com](https://console.aws.amazon.com)
2. Log in with your credentials (root user or IAM user)

> üí° Tip: Bookmark the AWS Console for easier access later.

### Step 2: Explore the Console Layout
- Note the **search bar** at the top where you can find any AWS service
- Explore the **recently visited services** section
- Hover over your name (top-right) to view account settings, billing, and sign-out options

### Step 3: Select a Region
1. In the upper-right corner, click the **Region selector** (e.g., US East (N. Virginia))
2. Browse the list of Regions and note the naming conventions

> üìå Example: `us-east-1` = US East (N. Virginia)

### Step 4: View the Global Infrastructure Map
1. Visit [https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/)
2. Scroll through the interactive map
3. Learn the difference between:
   - **Region**: A physical location with multiple Availability Zones
   - **Availability Zone (AZ)**: One or more discrete data centers
   - **Edge Locations**: CDN endpoints via Amazon CloudFront

### Step 5: Open and Pin Services
1. Open the **Services Menu** (top-left of the console)
2. Locate and open the following services:
   - EC2
   - S3
   - IAM
3. Pin them to the top for quick access

---

## ‚úÖ Validation Steps
- You should be logged into the AWS Console
- You should be able to identify at least one Region and Availability Zone
- You should have pinned 2‚Äì3 services to the console

---

## üìò Summary
In this lab, you learned how to:
- Log into the AWS Management Console
- Identify global infrastructure components (Regions, AZs, Edge Locations)
- Navigate the interface and pin frequently used services

This foundational understanding will help you explore core AWS services more efficiently in the following labs.

---

## ‚ùì Knowledge Check
1. What is the difference between a Region and an Availability Zone?
2. Why are edge locations important in AWS?
3. How can you quickly access a service like S3 from anywhere in the console?
