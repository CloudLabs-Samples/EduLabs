# Getting started with PaloAlto VMseries Firewall

## Tasks Included

In this hands-on lab you will perform the following tasks:

- **Task 1: Accessing the PaloAlto VMseries Firewall Dashboard**
- **Task 2: Login to Azure Portal**
- **Task 3: Getting Started with Azure Portal**
- **Task 4: The Application Command Center(ACC)**

## Overview

The Palo Alto Networks firewall allows you to specify security policies based on accurate identification of each application seeking access to your network. Unlike traditional firewalls that identify applications only by protocol and port number, the firewall uses packet inspection and a library of application signatures to distinguish between applications that have the same protocol and port, and to identify potentially malicious applications that use non-standard ports

# Task 4: Application Command Center(ACC)

## Overview

In this task, you can view the Application Command Center(ACC). This provides a detailed widget-based summary of the applications, and the default time is 1 hour. With the help of **Application Command Center(ACC)**, you can view the contextual linkage between the application and the content which allows you to make more security decisions.

The default view of **ACC** will show the network, threat, blocked, and tunnel activity in four separate tabs. The time frame and each tab can be customized to display the relevant application, and threat, and can view the user activity depending upon the user role.

1. Switch back to the PaloAlto VMseries Firewall dashboard Page, Click on the **ACC** tab.

    ![](../images/image06.png)

1. Since this is a new firewall, so you cannot able to view the data.

    ![](../images/image07.png)

   >Note: You can come back to this page at the end of the lab to see the data.

1. You can explore each of the widgets, by selecting the relevant data point. Clicking on the arrow towards the right of the filter will force all other widgets to be updated based on the context.
