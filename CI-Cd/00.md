## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 60 minutes

You should follow all of the steps provided in this section _before_ taking part in the hands-on lab ahead of time.

### Task 1: Create the Project Repo

In this task, you will create an account in [GitHub](https://github.com) and use `git` to add lab files to a new repository.

1. In a new browser tab open ```https://www.github.com``` and Log in with your personal GitHub account.

    > **Note** : You have to use your own GitHub account. If you don't have a GitHub account then navigate to the following link ```https://github.com/join``` and create one.
    
1. In the upper-right corner, expand the user drop down menu and select **Your repositories**.

   ![The user menu is expanded with the Your repositories item selected.](https://github.com/anushabc/MCW-Continuous-delivery-in-Azure-DevOps/blob/prod/Hands-on%20lab/media/image04.png?raw=true "User menu, your repositories")

1. Next to the search criteria, locate and select the **New** button.

   ![The GitHub Find a repository search criteria is shown with the New button selected.](https://github.com/anushabc/MCW-Continuous-delivery-in-Azure-DevOps/blob/prod/Hands-on%20lab/media/image05.png?raw=true "New repository button")

1. On the **Create a new repository** screen, name the repository ```mcw-continuous-delivery-lab-files```, select **Private** and click on **Create repository** button.

   >Note: If you have done this lab previously you may have the repository already created in your GitHub account, Please make sure the delete the Repo and create a new one. 

1. On the **Quick setup** screen, copy the **HTTPS** GitHub URL for your new repository, and paste this in notepad for future use.

   ![Quick setup screen is displayed with the copy button next to the GitHub URL textbox selected.](media/image26.png "Quick setup screen")


1. Open PowerShell with administrator and run the below commands to set your username and email, which git uses for commits. Make sure to replace your email and username.
   
     ```pwsh
     cd C:\Workspaces\lab\mcw-continuous-delivery-lab-files
     git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
     git config --global user.name "Your UserName"
     ```
     
    - Initialize the folder as a git repository, commit, and submit contents to the remote GitHub branch `main` in the lab files repository created in Step 1. Make sure to replace `<your_github_repository-url>` with the value you copied in step 5.

      > **Note**: The URI of the lab files GitHub repository created in Step 1 will differ from that in the example below.

      ```pwsh
      git init
      git add .
      git commit -m "Initial commit"
      git branch -M main
      git remote add origin <your_github_repository-url>
      git push -u origin main
      ```
      
    - After running the above commands, you will be prompted with a pop-up window to sign in to the GitHub. Select **Sign in with your Browser** on the pop-up window.
