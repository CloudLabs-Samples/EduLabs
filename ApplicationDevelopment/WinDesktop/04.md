# Exercise 4: Package the application and install it

By default, when you create a project using one of the built-in **WinUI project templates** that are provided with the Windows App SDK extension for Visual Studio, your project includes a **Windows Application Packaging** Project that is configured to build the app into an MSIX package.

> You can find more references about building  packaging and deploying the applications from here: `https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/package/packaging-uwp-apps`

In this exercise, you will package the application that you have built earlier in task 2 then install it. You will also run the application after installing it and then test its behavior by navigating between the two pages.

## Task 1: Configure your project with the manifest designer

The app manifest file (Package.appxmanifest) is an XML file that contains the properties and settings required to create your app package. For example, properties in the app manifest file describe the image to use as the tile of your app and the orientations that your app supports when a user rotates the device.

The Visual Studio manifest designer allows you to update the manifest file without editing the raw XML of the file.

In this task, you will create an app manifest file that is used in the next task to create an app package.

1. In Solution Explorer, double-click the Package.appxmanifest file. If the manifest file is already open in the XML code view, Visual Studio prompts you to close the file.

1. Select the **Packaging** tab and enter the below value in the package name field. 

   ```
   DemoWindowsapp-package
   ```

1. Leave other values as default and click on **File** then select **save Package.appxmanifest** to save the file.

## Task 2: Generate an app package and install it

Apps can be installed without being published in the Store by publishing them on your Website, using application management tools such as Microsoft Intune and Configuration Manager, etc. You can also directly install an MSIX package for testing on your local or remote machine.

In this task, you will generate an app package and install it on your local or remote machine then test the behavior of the application.

1. Right-click on the **DemoWindowsapp (package) (1)** project and select **Publish (2)** then **Create App Packages (3)**.

2. On the **Select distribution method** wizard, select **Sideloading (1)** and then click on **Next (2)**.

3. On the **Select signing method** page, select **Yes, select a certificate (1)** then **Select from File (2)**.

   > You can whether to skip packaging signing or select a certificate for signing. select a certificate from your local certificate store, select a certificate file, or create a new certificate. For an MSIX package to be installed on an end user's machine, it must be signed with a cert that is trusted on the machine.

4. Navigate to this path `C:\LabFiles` in the file explorer and select **UwpSigningCert.pfx (1)** then click on **Ok (2)**.

5. Now, enter the below password and click on **OK** to select the certificate.

    - Password: <inject key="Labvm Admin Password"></inject>

6. Click on **Next** on the **Select signing method** page.

7. On the **Select and Configure Packages** dialog, select the architecture configurations **(x86, x64)** to ensure that your app can be deployed to the widest range of devices and click on **Next (2)**.

8. On the **Configure update settings** blade, enter the below value in the **Installer location** field and click on **Create**.

   ```
   C:\Users\demouser\source\repos\DemoWindowsapp\
   ```

   ![](./media/packageapp-5.png)
   
9. Once the package is created you will be presented with the below page, click on **Close** to close the **Create App Packages** blade.

   ![](./media/packageapp-6.png)

10. Wait until the package is created. When your app has been successfully packaged, you will be presented with the below page.

   ![](./media/packageapp-7.png)


11. From the Virtual Machine, open the file explorer and navigate to the below path to locate the PowerShell script file that installs the app package.

   `C:\Users\demouser\source\repos\DemoWindowsapp\DemoWindowsapp\DemoWindowsapp (Package)\AppPackages\DemoWindowsapp (Package)_1.0.0.0_Debug_Test`
   
12. Right-click on the **Add-AppDevPackage.ps1** file. Choose **Run with PowerShell**. 

   ![](./media/installapp-1.png)

13. When prompted to confirm the installation of the certificate, enter **Y** and click **enter** to accept and continue the installation.

   ![](./media/installapp-2.png)

14. Once the app installation is done you will receive the below message, click **enter** again to close the PowerShell session.

   ![](./media/installapp-3.1.png)

15. Go to the Start button in the VM, search for  **DemoWindowsapp**, and double-click on **DemoWindowsapp (package)** app to run the application.

   ![](./media/installapp-3.png)
   
16. When the application is launched, Page1 will be loaded by default as you have configured the **MainWindow** method earlier to load Page1.

   ![](./media/buildapp-3.png)

17. Now, click on the **Go to Page 2** button to navigate to Page2.

   ![](./media/buildapp-4.png)

18. Click on **X** on the Page 2 to close the page and stop the application.


### Summary  
In this task, you have created an app manifest file that will be used to create an app package. You have also generated the app package and installed it on your local or remote machine then run the application to test its behavior.
